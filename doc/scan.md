### 7. Upload files

Go to 'Files' and you will see a NeRFCapture folder.
Sometimes the zip file is corrupted, so it is best to compress the original image data.
Then, you can share the data to test the pipeline.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Tips

- üì∏ Try to hold the phone steady while scanning ‚Äî motion blur can degrade quality. (e.g., pause for 1.5 ~ 2 seconds after each frame)
  - Also, try to overlap at least 30% of the previous frame for better quality.
- üóúÔ∏è If the ZIP export is corrupted, re-compress the original folder manually before processing.
